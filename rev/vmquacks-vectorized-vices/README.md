Description:

The quacking duck mob at your local pond are now really mad! You broke their vm based anti-quack system for two years in a row!
However, don't rest easy - one of their brightest quackers have designed something absolutely devious with a revamped compiler,
inspired after reading a textbook on SIMD programming. Now, the ducks are confident that their vector based obfuscation scheme will 
quack your sanity. Can you quack their quackme now?

Note that this challenge requires AVX-512 F, CD, DQ, BW, and was verified to work on a Cascade Lake system. The challenge is completely
doable and even developed under [Intel SDE](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/tool/software-development-emulator.html).

To help you get started with deobfuscating the VM, we have decided to provide a sample C program (quicksort) along with its obfuscated version.
