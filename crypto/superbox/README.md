Description:

SUPERCORP has recently introduced its state-of-the-art ternary-based encryption scheme. 
Although they have made their SBOX confidential, they have assured it is secure.
Nevertheless, an insider has leaked internal files relating to SUPERBOX, along with a sample of SUPERENCRYPT at work.

This scheme is now being used as encryption in its cloud storage service.
However we aren't sure about some of the "patents" being used... can you spot anything fishy? ðŸ¤”
