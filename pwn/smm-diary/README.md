Description:

```
From ring 3's embrace, the CTF journey takes flight,
To breach the veil, ascending to a greater height.
Amidst the vulnerable code, a challenge emerges,
From glibc's grip, where Malloc Maleficarum surges.
Through the labyrinth of heap notes, the path does unfold,
Unveiling the secrets, as memory stories are told.

With prowess and cunning, pwners breach the kernel's gate,
Transcending to ring 0, where root privilege awaits.
Pens dipped in exploits, they craft their design,
A symphony of bytes, in elegant lines.  
With each kernel note challenge, a test of their might,
They conquer challenges and 0-days, unlocking new light

Alas, beyond kernelmode, the odyssey persists,
For the final destination, a secret timeless abyss.
Into the enigmatic hell of ring -2 and SMRAM they dive,
Where shadowy rootkits lurk and firmware exploits thrive.
In this poetic ode to CTF's flight,
Discover the exploits, in SMM's twilight.


Welcome to the horrors of System Management Mode exploits.
