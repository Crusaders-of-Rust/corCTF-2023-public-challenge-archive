Description:

During the darkest period of the Molussian freedom movement, two prisioners, like
so many of their comrades, had to spend their lives in the dungeons of the Molussian state prison.

Olo, the older prisoner, conveys to Yegussa, the younger, the lessons necessary to perpetuate
the struggle for freedom â€“ lessons that he himself once learned from an older prisoner,
and which Yegussa is one day to pass on to the next generation.

Embrace the role of Yegussa, don't let the chain be broken, escape from the Molussian Catacomb
and become the torchbearer of the fight for freedom.
